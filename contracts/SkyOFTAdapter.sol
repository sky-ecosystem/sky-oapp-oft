/**
 * @title SkyOFTAdapter Contract
 * @dev OFTAdapter is a contract that adapts an ERC-20 token to the OFT functionality.
 * @dev This contract extends the DoubleSidedRateLimiter contract to provide double-sided rate limiting functionality.
 * @dev It allows for the configuration of rate limits for both outbound and inbound directions.
 * @dev It also allows for the setting of the rate limit accounting type to be net or gross.
 *
 * @dev For existing ERC20 tokens, this can be used to convert the token to cross-chain compatibility.
 * @dev WARNING: ONLY 1 of these should exist for a given global mesh,
 * unless you make a NON-default implementation of OFT and needs to be done very carefully.
 * @dev WARNING: The default OFTAdapter implementation assumes LOSSLESS transfers, ie. 1 token in, 1 token out.
 * IF the 'innerToken' applies something like a transfer fee, the default will NOT work...
 * a pre/post balance check will need to be done to calculate the amountSentLD/amountReceivedLD.
